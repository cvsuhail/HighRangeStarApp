# Purchase Order Upload Testing Guide

## 🚀 Firebase Cloud Storage Upload is Now Functional!

The purchase order upload functionality has been successfully implemented with Firebase Cloud Storage. Here's how to test it:

## 📋 Testing Steps

### 1. **Access the Application**
- The development server is running at: `http://localhost:3002`
- Navigate to a thread detail page (e.g., `/threads/HRS-QN-25003-S70`)

### 2. **Test the Upload Functionality**

#### Option A: Test in Thread Detail Page
1. Go to any thread detail page
2. Navigate to **Step 2: Upload Purchase Order**
3. Enter a Purchase Order ID (e.g., "PO-12345")
4. Upload a PDF file using the file upload component
5. Check the browser console for detailed logs

#### Option B: Use the Test Page
1. Navigate to `/test-upload` in your browser
2. Sign in if not already authenticated
3. Upload a test PDF file
4. Check the browser console for detailed logs

### 3. **What to Look For**

#### ✅ Success Indicators:
- File uploads without errors
- Console shows detailed progress logs
- File appears in Firebase Storage
- Download URL is generated
- Thread status updates to "PurchaseOrderUploaded"
- Active step advances to step 3

#### 🔍 Debug Information:
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for detailed logs
- Look for any error messages
- Verify Firebase Storage rules are applied

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Components Created/Updated:**
1. **FileUpload Component** (`src/components/form/FileUpload.tsx`)
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - PDF validation and size limits
   - Loading states and error handling

2. **Thread Detail Page** (`src/app/(admin)/threads/[threadId]/page.tsx`)
   - Integrated file upload functionality
   - Added debugging logs
   - Enhanced UI for purchase order step

3. **QuotationService** (`src/lib/quotationService.ts`)
   - Enhanced with detailed logging
   - Proper error handling
   - Firebase Storage integration

4. **Firebase Storage Rules** (`storage.rules`)
   - Deployed to Firebase
   - Proper security rules for authenticated users
   - PDF file type validation

### **Firebase Configuration:**
- Project ID: `hrstar-270fa`
- Storage Bucket: `hrstar-270fa.firebasestorage.app`
- Rules deployed and active

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Authentication Required**
   - Make sure you're signed in to the application
   - Check if user is authenticated in browser console

2. **File Type Validation**
   - Only PDF files are accepted
   - Check file MIME type is `application/pdf`

3. **Storage Rules**
   - Rules are deployed and should allow authenticated users
   - Check Firebase Console for any rule violations

4. **Network Issues**
   - Check browser network tab for failed requests
   - Verify Firebase project configuration

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check Firebase project status
firebase projects:list

# Check storage rules
firebase storage:rules:get

# View Firebase Console
firebase open storage
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

1. **File Selection**: User can drag-drop or click to select PDF files
2. **Validation**: Only PDF files under 10MB are accepted
3. **Upload**: File uploads to Firebase Storage with progress indication
4. **Storage**: File stored at path: `purchaseOrders/{threadId}/PO_{poId}_{filename}`
5. **Database**: Document created in Firestore with download URL
6. **UI Update**: Thread status updates and advances to next step

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ File uploads successfully to Firebase Storage
- ✅ Download URL is generated and stored
- ✅ Thread status updates correctly
- ✅ UI shows uploaded files with download links
- ✅ Workflow advances to next step
- ✅ No console errors during upload process

## 📝 Notes

- All uploads are logged to browser console for debugging
- Files are stored securely with proper authentication
- Storage rules ensure only authenticated users can upload
- Error handling includes cleanup of failed uploads
- UI provides clear feedback during upload process

The purchase order upload functionality is now fully operational with Firebase Cloud Storage! 🎉
